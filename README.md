This is a movie search app made with React for ACA project. It has a backend with MySQL that stores users with a sign up and login page. I wanted to add functionality to favorite and suggest movies, but my skills met with time constraints didn't allow me to get all the way there. So I believe I am hitting all the graduation requirements with what the app does, however couldn't complete the intended functionality. Hope to in the future!!

It should direct you to the Sign Up page at the root url, once you create a user, it will route you to the log in page, and once you log in you have access to the movie searcher.

Thanks for taking a look!
